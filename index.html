        <br>The goal of this class is to teach students the necessary concepts
         and programming skills to work on a self-driving car. To achieve this,
         students will be given lectures/labs on a variety of different content
         in order to familiarize themselves with some of the challenges embedded
         in the self-driving problem. The scope of content will include
         Deep Learning/Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, and Control Systems.
         In addition, students will be exposed to a lot of the specific
         challenges that self-driving cars face, and will be challenged to find
         solutions to these issues.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p><font color="#0080FF">Available Machines</font>
        <br>There are 2 machines dedicated to this course. Each machine has
        an NVIDIA GPU TitanXP. Accesses to these machines are granted by
        Instructor and TAs. Any hardware problems regarding these machines
        should be reported to TAs via course Slack.
        <br>Machine names:
        <ul>
          <li>atlas.ece.ucdavis.edu</li>
          <li>kronos.ece.ucdavis.edu</li>
        </ul>
        <br>There are 3 NVIDIA Jetsons dedicated to the labs. These boards are
        located in lab. Unless with the consent of instructor or TAs, students
        may not remove these boards from the lab.
        <br>Machine names:

      <p><font color="#0080FF">Extra Credit</font>
        <br>There will be weekly opportunities for extra credit should students
        show extra initiative in learning material related to any of the topics
        covered. Up to an extra 5% will be awarded to students every lab if they
        add a topic they learned about in addition to the material that was
        covered during the week.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><font color="#0080FF">Communication</font>
        <br>Except for submitting assignments on Canvas, all communication
        about the course should be done through course Slack. Slack is a great
        medium to ask questions and setup meetings. Aside from updating the course
        Schedule table, all notification will be made through Slack.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><font color="#0080FF">Open-sourced Material</font>
        <br>All course material, including videos, lecture slides and
        assignments are made open-sourced. The EEC193 course allows registered
        students to secure seats in class, access to machines and feedbacks from
        teaching faculty. The materials will be published weekly, to guarantee
        registered students have first access to the assignments. After that,
        auditing students are free to do the assignments.

    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Labs</font>
        <ul>
          <li>All lab reports must be submitted by the deadline specified in the
          course schedule. No late submission is accepted unless instructor or TAs
          are notified at least 2 days ahead of the deadline.
          </li>
          <li>Unless specified otherwise, all lab works must be done individually.
          Students will be reported to SJA for suspicion of cheating or
          unauthorized colaborations. That said, high-level discussions are
          acceptable, and students are encouraged to help each other during lab
          (clarifying lab's objective, discussing high-level concepts,
          approaches, ... ). Consult instructor or TAs if it is unclear an
          activity counted as unauthorized colaborations.
          </li>
          <li>Plagiarism in lab reports and source codes is strictly forbidden.
            This applied to material found online. Viewing source codes that can
            aid finishing the lab from the Internet or other classmates can
            influenced how students approach solving the lab's problem. So, it
            is highly recommended not to search up the solution to the lab.
            There are mechanisms in place that check for plagiarism in students'
            submitted source codes and lab reports. All incidents of suspected
            plagiarism will be reported to SJA.
          </li>
          <li>Each student is provided with a lab key. It is the student's
          responsibility to return the key at the end of the courses. Attempts to
          replicate the key will be reported.
          </li>
          <li>Students may only use class hardware and machines strictly for
          class-related purposes. Any other activities are forbidden.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Grading Errors and Post-submission Discussion</font>
        <br>The majority of the students' grade comes from their lab works and
        reports. The course provides opportunities for students to do well by
        giving students a chance to discuss their grades.
        It is possible for students to request regrades, if one of the following
        conditions applied:
        <ul>
          <li>Student think there is a grading error. Lab coding solutions will
            be released for each lab after submission deadline.
          </li>
          <li>Student think they can demonstrate their understanding of the
            material better after receiving the grade. This applied mainly to
            the lab report. The course objective is to help students prepared
            for the AI industry. Students should view their grades as
            constructive feedbacks designed to help students find areas which
            they need to improve on. After recieving the grade, and through
            addressing areas in need of improvement, students can setup a
            demonstration session with TAs to prove that they have understood
            the given material. If TAs find the demonstration satisfactory,
            the student's grade will be raised to theoretically 100% of the
            assignment. Demonstration session can must be scheduled outside of
            TAs office hours, either in person or online through Slack conference.
